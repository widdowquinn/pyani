"""Code to implement the ANIb average nucleotide identity method.

Calculates ANI by the ANIb method, as described in Goris et al. (2007)
Int J Syst Evol Micr 57: 81-91. doi:10.1099/ijs.0.64483-0.

From Goris et al.

'''The genomic sequence from one of the genomes in a pair (the query)
was cut into consecutive 1020 nt fragments. The 1020 nt cut-off was used
to correspond with the fragmentation of the genomic DNA to approximately
1 kb fragments during the DDH experiments. [...] The 1020 nt fragments
were then used to search against the whole genomic sequence of the other
genome in the pair (the reference) by using the BLASTN algorithm;
the best BLASTN match was saved for further analysis. The BLAST
algorithm was run using the following settings: X=150 (where X is the
drop-off value for gapped alignment), q=-1 (where q is the penalty
for nucleotide mismatch) and F=F (where F is the filter for repeated
sequences); the rest of the parameters were used at the default settings.
These settings give better sensitivity than the default settings when
more distantly related genomes are being compared, as the latter
target sequences that are more similar to each other.
[...]
The ANI between the query genome and the reference genome was
calculated as the mean identity of all BLASTN matches that showed more
than 30% overall sequence identity (recalculated to an identity along
the entire sequence) over an alignable region of at least 70% of their
length. This cut-off is above the 'twilight zone' of similarity searches in
which an inference of homology is error prone because of low levels of
Reverse searching, i.e. in which the reference genome is used as the
query, was also performed to provide reciprocal values.'''

All input FASTA format files are used to construct BLAST databases.
Each file's contents are also split into sequence fragments of length
options.fragsize, and the multiple FASTA file that results written to
the output directory. These are BLASTNed, pairwise, against the
databases.

BLAST output is interrogated for all fragment matches that cover
at least 70% of the query sequence, with at least 30% nucleotide
identity over the full length of the query sequence. This is an odd
choice and doesn't correspond to the twilight zone limit as implied by
Goris et al. We persist with their definition, however.  Only these
qualifying matches contribute to the total aligned length, and total
aligned sequence identity used to calculate ANI.
