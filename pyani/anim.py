"""Code to implement the ANIm average nucleotide identity method.

Calculates ANI by the ANIm method, as described in Richter et al (2009)
Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106: 19126-19131 doi:10.1073/pnas.0906412106.

All input FASTA format files are compared against each other, pairwise,
using NUCmer (binary location must be provided). NUCmer output will be stored
in a specified output directory.

The NUCmer .delta file output is parsed to obtain an alignment length
and similarity error count for every unique region alignment. These are
processed to give matrices of aligned sequence lengths, similarity error
counts, average nucleotide identity (ANI) percentages, and minimum aligned
percentage (of whole genome) for each pairwise comparison.

    """Return (alignment length, similarity errors) tuple from passed .delta.

    :param filename:  Path, path to the input .delta file

    Extracts the aligned length and number of similarity errors for each
    aligned uniquely-matched region, and returns the cumulative total for
    each as a tuple.

    Similarity errors are defined in the .delta file spec (see below) as
    non-positive match scores. For NUCmer output, this is identical to the
    number of errors (non-identities and indels).

    Delta file format has seven numbers in the lines of interest:
    see http://mummer.sourceforge.net/manual/ for specification

    - start on query
    - end on query
    - start on target
    - end on target
    - error count (non-identical, plus indels)
    - similarity errors (non-positive match scores)
        [NOTE: with PROmer this is equal to error count]
    - stop codons (always zero for nucmer)

    To calculate alignment length, we take the length of the aligned region of
    the reference (no gaps), and process the delta information. This takes the
    form of one value per line, following the header sequence. Positive values
    indicate an insertion in the reference; negative values a deletion in the
    reference (i.e. an insertion in the query). The total length of the alignment
    is then:

    reference_length + insertions - deletions

    For example:

    A = ABCDACBDCAC$
    B = BCCDACDCAC$
    Delta = (1, -3, 4, 0)
    A = ABC.DACBDCAC$
    B = .BCCDAC.DCAC$

    A is the reference and has length 11. There are two insertions (positive delta),
    and one deletion (negative delta). Alignment length is then 11 + 1 = 12.
