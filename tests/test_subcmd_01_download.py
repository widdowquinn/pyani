"""Test download subcommand for pyani.

The test suite is intended to be run from the repository root using:

pytest -v

Each command CMD available at the command line as pyani <CMD> is
tested in its own class as a subclass of unittest.TestCase, where
setUp() defines input/output files, a null logger (which is also
picked up by pytest), and a dictionary of command lines, keyed
by test name, with values representing command-line options.

For each test, command line options are defined in a Namespace and
passed as the sole argument to the appropriate subcommand.

As the download operations are slow, and subject to network issues,
especially with CI, we mock the download operations.
