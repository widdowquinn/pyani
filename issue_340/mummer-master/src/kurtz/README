This directory contains the complete sources for 'mummer' (maxmat3.x) in three
subdirectories:

- libbasedir contains some basic functions which are used for other programs
  as well. To simplify reusing them I have put them in an extra library.

- streesrc contains the source for the suffix tree library.

- mm3src contains the application specific source code for the
  program maxmat3.x

You can compile it using make. Since we use include statements
in Makefile's your make has to support this feature. This e.g.
holds for gnu make.

The code was tested for the following platforms:

- linux on Intel PIII
- solaris2 on SUN-Sparc
- tru64 on Compaq-Alpha
- hp-machine with HP-UX


#-- FOR DEVELOPERS --#
If you would prefer to build the suffix tree source from this directory rather
than the top level MUMmer directory, please uncomment the lines that begin with
'##' in the Makefiles for each subdirectory to assure they use the appropriate
values for compilation.
