    abstract  ="Soft rot Enterobacteriaceae (SRE) are bacterial plant pathogens that cause blackleg{,} wilt and soft rot
    diseases on a broad range of important crop and ornamental plants worldwide. These organisms (spanning the genera Erwinia{,}
    Pectobacterium{,} Dickeya{,} and Pantoea) cause significant economic and yield losses in the field{,} and in storage. They
    are transmissible through surface water{,} by trade and other movement of plant material and soil{,} and in some cases are
    subject to international legislative and quarantine restrictions. Effective detection and diagnosis in support of food
    security legislation and epidemiology is dependent on the ability to classify pathogenic isolates precisely. Diagnostics and
    classification are made more difficult by the influence of horizontal gene transfer on phenotype{,} and historically complex
    and sometimes inaccurate nomenclatural and taxonomic assignments that persist in strain collections and online sequence
    databases. Here{,} we briefly discuss the relationship between taxonomy{,} genotype and phenotype in the SRE{,} and their
    implications for diagnostic testing and legislation. We present novel whole-genome classifications of the SRE{,}
    illustrating inconsistencies between the established taxonomies and evidence from completely sequenced isolates. We conclude
    with a perspective on the future impact of widespread whole-genome sequencing and classification methods on detection and
    identification of bacterial plant pathogens in support of legislative and policy efforts in food security."}
