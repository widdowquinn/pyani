``pyani`` subcommands
=====================

``pyani`` has a subcommand structure, where the command ``pyani`` is followed immediately by a subcommand to let the software know which action you wish it to perform, in the format ``pyani <subcommand>``. For example, to create a database you would use the ``createdb`` subcommand:

.. code-block:: bash

    pyani createdb

This document links out to detailed instructions for each of the ``pyani`` subcommands.
